    Animating was a lot of fun !
For my final project I used elements from my raster and vector projects to make them feel alive . I took on a challenge with learning to how make the astronauts hand make a movement as the entire astronaut is also moving down the screen. It worked out and with more time I would have made more limbs move and dangle around.
