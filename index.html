    I felt the urgency to learn Visual Media Design for my Marketing career aswell as for Lifes long journey of Entrepreneurship and creativity. 
This class has helped me gain the skills neccessary to apply to many design scenarios, where in the past I had to outsource. </p>
    <p>
        I look forward to continue my creative journies with more understanding and capabilies of visual media design for both professional scenarios and to compliment my Sound Design ventures for my alias name Vitalman.   </p>
